### Vite config

After installing the package, you can create a `manifest.ts` required for PWA to work.

```
You can also create your own `workbox.config.ts`  or the default one will be used.

### Typescript config

After installing the package, a `tsconfig.json` file will be created in the root directory if it did not exist before. If you already have a `tsconfig.json` file, add the following to it:

```ts
	"extends": "@atomazing-org/vite-config/configs/tsconfig.json",
```
